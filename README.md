# WebStore
Example of Web Store made for portfolio. Was made for GeekBrains courses with ASP.NET MVC.
Contains Login Page, Page with Product List with features of adding, editing and deleting Products and adding them to Cart. Made with Bootstrap.
Database of Users, Products and their Categories was wade using Entity Framework, Automapper and Autofac.
Cart of Products is stored using cookies.

This example is still in progress, there should be role-separated functions and views, better cart and presentation of product list by categories. Probably would be done by 10 of december.
